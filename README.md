# MVC Pattern App with PHP

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software architecture pattern, which separates the data and business logic of an application from its representation and the module responsible for managing events and communications.
Some web development frameworks such as AngularJS, Spring, Symfony or Laravel make use of this pattern to organize the resources of the application. This is because it is a very popular and easy to implement pattern. Thanks to this pattern we manage to obtain an architecture that allows us to organize our project resources in a scalable way.

In this project we will implement one of the most common architecture patterns.

## Getting started 🚀

1 - What is an architecture pattern?

```
An Architectural Pattern it’s a predefine structural
organization. It provides a set of predefined subsystems,
their responsibilities, and organize the relationships
between them.
```

2 - What is the MVC pattern?

```
It’s an Arquitectural Pattern thought for web applications whose
workflow include database calls; MVC = Model, View, Controller
architecture. Model = SQL / View = HTML + CSS /
Controller = JS or PHP
```

3 - Draw a scheme where you understand that the MVC pattern is clearly

4 - Explain in which cases you would use this pattern

```
It's recommanded when you will design an App that need a
GUI(Grafical User Interface)'View', that need to sen send
querys to the database 'Model' and gets the data with functionality 'Controller'
```

5.Describe step by step what happens in this pattern from when you create a Request until a Response is returned (you can give more than one example if you consider it necessary).

```
1- The Model send the query
2- the Controller requier the data of the function of Model
3- the Controller requie the viewer file (this naw have acces to the data
that recollect the model)
4- The index call to the controller

```

6 - What advantages do you think this pattern has to use?

```
MVC enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together.
The views for a specific model are also grouped together
```

## Instalation 🔧

Steps to set the project base:

```
npm install
```

Run in your SQL Server the two files that you will find in
`/php-mvc-pattern-basics/resources/`

```
SQLcreate.sql
```

```
SQLcommands.sql
```
